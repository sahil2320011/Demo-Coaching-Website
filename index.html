                    Mr Sahil Sharma, a Electrical Engineering Graduate from
                    NIT, Calicut.We started to make a difference in
                    the way Students think and approach problems.It was
                    the urge, the compelling desire, to always aspire for
                    perfection and in the process, continuously keep on
                    setting newer benchmarks of excellence, which enabled
                    us and our Students to achieve what we have achieved.</p>

              <q class="test">You always need to give inputs to get an output(students who code know it quite well)......But seriously this is what makes Groww Education different from other jee preparation coachings in India since it is the place where your inputs are valued the most and you get the most of your inputs... Here your inputs are integrated by the maths faculties, balanced stoichiometrically by chemistry faculties....</q>

              <q class="test">The atmosphere here is extremely motivating. The small batch strength helped me interact with my teachers and clear my doubts. The extra efforts put in by the faculty members to cover the syllabus in time helped me top in my school also.Also i was a dropper and the whole team motivated me always.They where always there when i need there help. I use to call Sahil Sir , at late hours to ask my doubts .</q>

        <p class="text-big sectionTag1">Why Groww Education?</p>
        <p class="text-small sectionsubTag1">Groww Education, since its inception in 1992, has been serving the Students of this Country with utmost sincerity, just like a True Guru.
            We have been abiding by a Value System which revolves around Truth, Transparency & Commitment. Our Unique Innovations in the
            field of preparing Students for IIT-JEE NEET AIIMS & Other Competitive / Scholastic Exams have always proved to be very helpful in empowering
            Students to reach the pinnacle of Success. And all these traits have led Groww Education into becoming the only Institute of Real Substance !</p>

    <section class="secRight">
        <p class="text-big sectionTag1">Our Methodology</p>
        <p class="text-small sectionsubTag1">Groww Education has always been preparing Students in a fundamental
            way. Groww Education has been teaching in a comprehensive manner
            so that Students do well in IIT-JEE (irrespective of the pattern)NEET AIIMS,
            Boards, NTSE, KVPY, Olympiads and Other Engineering
            Entrance Exams. For many years, our Students have been
            securing admissions in the top 10 US Universities where
            admission is based on the performance at School + Last Board
            Exam and SAT-I, SAT-II, AP Exams & TOEFL.
            The Testing pattern of IIT-JEE also keeps on changing but the
            key aspect of the test is to judge the analytical ability of the
            aspirants along with the understanding of fundamentals.
            Students having sound understanding of fundamental
            concepts & practising varied types of problems will always
            outperform the Students who confine their preparation to the
            exam pattern only, rather than understanding the concepts.</p>

    <section class="secRight">
